# Modeling the Transmission of Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia

## Motivation

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV, or MERS) is a viral infection that affects the respiratory system. It has a fatality rate of approximately 35%. The virus was first discovered in 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Since then, there have been several outbreaks of MERS in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, an outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, believed to have been brought there by a traveler from Saudi Arabia.

The virus is known to have crossed over into the human population from camels, among which the disease is endemic. It is evident that the virus is not particularly virulent among humans, as the total number of infections over more than a decade amounts to several thousand. However, the very high fatality rate and the possibility of spreading to other places, as it did in 2015, motivate interest in modeling the spread of this virus.

This project analyzes MERS cases in Saudi Arabia from January 2014 to May 2016. The analysis is conducted in two main stages:
1. We first apply ARIMA time series models to examine the data.
2. We then explore the data further using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) model to simulate the spread of MERS within the camel population.

## Methodology

### ARMA Benchmark

</p>

The best ARMA model based on the AIC criterion is ARMA(1,4) with an AIC of 859.54. All the coefficients except MA4 are significant at the 5% level. We use this as a benchmark to compare our mechanistic SEIRS model against.

### SEIRS POMP model

We initially attempted to model MERS spread among humans as a partially observed Markov process (POMP) but failed to find a satisfactory model. The simulations either resulted in widespread disease transmission or no spread at all, depending on the transmission rate $\beta$. In reality, MERS is not very virulent and it persists in Saudi Arabia with very small case numbers, occasionally spiking to dozens.

[Lin et al. (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29846148/) proposed a more effective POMP model that accounts for MERS' primary spread among the camel population. This model treats the camel spread as the Markov process and considers human cases as a function of infectious camels. It uses a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) compartment model for MERS spread among camels, assuming a constant camel population in Saudi Arabia, and assumes human cases originate from infectious camels at time $t$.

Our project builds upon Lin et al.'s model with some modifications.

We fit the model using the likelihood maximization approach, and conduct both local and global searches for the best parameters. The best SEIRS model from global search has a maximized log-likelihood of -378.33, which is significantly higher than that of the ARMA(1,4) model.

We simulate the model at the best parameters from a global search:

- The simulation fits the data relatively well. The first major peak and the peak around week 80 are captured.

The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is defined as the average number of cases generated by a typical case and it quantifies the contagiousness or transmissibility of an infectious disease (source: [CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article#)). It can be calculated as:
```math
R_0 = \dfrac{\beta}{\mu_{IR}}
```
For our best SEIRS model, this is estimated to be 2.6.


# Conclusion

This project analyzed MERS cases in Saudi Arabia from January 2014 to May 2016 using two approaches:
1. **ARIMA Modeling**: An ARMA(1,4) model was found to fit the data well and provides a reasonable benchmark.
2. **SEIRS Modeling**: Based on Lin et al. (2018), this model simulated MERS spread among the camel population. It treated camel stage transitions as a hidden Markov process. The model accounted for camel-to-human spillover, which represents the primary infections. These primary infections constitute approximately 25% of the total human MERS cases.

Key findings:
   - The estimated basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is 2.6, which aligns with Lin et al.'s range.
   - Parameters were identified that simulated major outbreaks and peaks in the data.
   - The spillover rate effectively explained the overall case numbers.

This approach successfully captured the dynamics of MERS transmission in both camel and human populations.
